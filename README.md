# Introduction

The U.S. Department of Transportation’s Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) keeps an eye on how well big airlines are doing with their on-time flights within the country. They share a monthly report called the Air Travel Consumer Report, which tells us about the number of flights that were on time, delayed, canceled, or diverted. This report comes out about a month after each month ends, and you can also find summary tables on their website.

Starting from June 2003, BTS also started collecting information about what’s causing flight delays. And guess what? All this data is available to the public when they release the Air Travel Consumer Report. So if you want to know how flights are performing and why there might be delays, BTS has got all the info you need!

### Delay Problem
The airlines report the causes of delays in five broad categories:
- Air Carrier : The cause of the cancellation or delay was due to circumstances within the airline’s control (e.g. maintenance or crew problems, aircraft cleaning, baggage loading, fueling, etc.)
- Extreme Weather : Significant meteorological conditions (actual or forecasted) that, in the judgment of the carrier, delays or prevents the operation of a flight such as tornado, blizzard or hurricane.
- National Aviation System (NAS) : Delays and cancellations attributable to the national aviation system that refer to a broad set of conditions, such as non-extreme weather conditions, airport operations, heavy traffic volume, and air traffic control.
- Late-arriving aircraft : A previous flight with same aircraft arrived late, causing the present flight to depart late.
- Security : Delays or cancellations caused by evacuation of a terminal or concourse, re-boarding of aircraft because of security breach, inoperative screening equipment and/or long lines in excess of 29 minutes at screening areas.
 

This dataset may contain information on the names of airlines, the names of airports, the number of flights in each city and state, the number of flight delays on each airline, etc. I intend to evaluate this data to learn more about how big flight delays are and causes them.

## Objectives
- Delay problem : See how many flight delays there are for each delay problem
- Carrier Delay Trent : Graph of flight delays every year (July 2003 - March 2023)
- Airport delay : See the number of flight delays at each airport
- Most causes delay : see the most causes of delay for each year
- Flight delays on state : see how big the flight delays are in the state
- Delay by carrier : which airlines are experiencing the most delays
